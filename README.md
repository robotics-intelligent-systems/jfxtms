# Description and Context

**JFXAI4ATS** is an open-source reference platform for **AI-powered automated trading, quantitative finance, financial market analysis, algorithmic strategy development, execution, risk management, and trading-system engineering**.

The project consolidates an ecosystem of open-source technologies and research projects related to:

- quantitative investment;
- algorithmic trading;
- AI-powered trading agents;
- reinforcement learning;
- financial machine learning;
- market simulation;
- portfolio optimization;
- risk analytics;
- financial messaging;
- FIX protocol integration;
- high-performance market data;
- exchange and matching-engine infrastructure;
- trading APIs;
- backtesting;
- financial performance analysis;
- cloud-native trading systems;
- model-based systems engineering.

The current repository contains a broad technology inventory including Qlib, FinRL, TradingAgents, OctoBot, StockSharp, QuantLib, QuickFIX/J, Aeron, vn.py, Qbot, TradeMaster, WonderTrader, Exchange-Core and other financial technologies. It also incorporates an MBSE/CAD/CAM/CAS engineering structure.  

The project is therefore positioned as a **reference architecture and technology compendium**, rather than claiming that every listed project is a mandatory runtime dependency.

# AI Trading Agents

The platform can integrate agent-oriented architectures for:

```text
Research Agent
      │
      ├── Market Data Agent
      ├── News / NLP Agent
      ├── Quant Agent
      ├── Strategy Agent
      ├── Risk Agent
      ├── Portfolio Agent
      └── Execution Agent
```

An agent workflow can follow:

```text
Observe
  ↓
Collect Data
  ↓
Analyze Market
  ↓
Generate Hypothesis
  ↓
Generate Signal
  ↓
Risk Evaluation
  ↓
Human / Policy Approval
  ↓
Order Generation
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Monitoring
  ↓
Post-Trade Analysis
```

AI agents should remain subject to deterministic trading limits and explicit risk controls.

---

# Trading and Execution

The execution subsystem provides a conceptual framework for:

- order creation;
- order validation;
- order routing;
- order lifecycle management;
- execution reports;
- fills;
- cancellations;

- reference data;
- market calendars;
- alternative financial data.

A canonical normalized representation should be used before data is consumed by strategies.

Example:

```text
External Provider
       ↓
Data Adapter
       ↓
Normalization
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Time Synchronization
       ↓
Historical Store
       ↓
Feature Store
       ↓

## Integration Tests

Validate:

- broker APIs;
- FIX gateways;
- market-data adapters;
- databases;
- messaging;
- exchange adapters.

## Backtesting Tests

Validate:

- deterministic results;
- historical data integrity;
- transaction costs;
- slippage;
- latency assumptions.

## AI Evaluation

Evaluate:

- predictive performance;
- model stability;
- data leakage;
- overfitting;
- distribution shift;
- model drift.

## Production Validation

Before enabling live trading:

    ↓

    ↓
Walk-Forward
    ↓
Stress Test
    ↓

# Security and Financial Controls

Security is critical because the platform can potentially interact with financial accounts and trading venues.

## Credential Management

Never store:

```text
API keys
Secrets
Passwords
Private keys
Broker credentials
```

directly in source code.

Use:

- environment variables;
- secret managers;
- encrypted configuration;
- managed identity;
- Kubernetes Secrets with appropriate protection.

## Trading Controls

Every live execution environment should implement:

- maximum order size;
- maximum daily loss;
- maximum exposure;
- position limits;
- rate limits;
- kill switch;
- emergency shutdown;
- audit logs.

## AI Safety

AI agents must not be allowed to directly override:

- risk limits;
- compliance rules;
- position limits;
- account permissions;
- emergency controls.

# Code of Conduct

All contributors should maintain a professional and respectful environment.

Contributions should:

- respect other developers;
- document technical decisions;
- avoid malicious trading logic;
- avoid credential exposure;
- avoid intentionally unsafe financial automation;
- follow the project's security policies.

A dedicated `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` should be maintained in the repository root.

# Authors

**Robotics Intelligent Systems**

Repository:

https://github.com/robotics-intelligent-systems/jfxai4ats

The repository should be used to identify current maintainers and contributors.

# Additional Information

## Related Engineering Domains

JFXAI4ATS follows the broader engineering structure used by the Robotics Intelligent Systems repositories:

```text
MBSE
 └── Arcadia / Capella
      │
      ├── CAD
      ├── CAM
      └── CAS
```

This allows financial trading-system architecture to be connected to a broader Model-Based Systems Engineering methodology.

## Related Open-Source Ecosystems

The project can be evaluated alongside:

- Qlib;
- FinRL;
- QuantLib;
- Strata;
- StockSharp;
- vn.py;
- QuickFIX/J;
- Aeron;
- Exchange-Core;
- TradingAgents;
- TradeMaster;
- WonderTrader.

These projects should be considered complementary technologies, references, or integration candidates rather than automatically implied dependencies.

---

# License

The license for JFXAI4ATS should be explicitly defined in the repository's root `LICENSE` file.

If the repository has not yet selected a license, contributors should evaluate an appropriate open-source license before distributing executable software.

Potential choices include:

- Apache-2.0;
- MIT;
- BSD-3-Clause;
- GPL-3.0;

# Architectural Principles

JFXAI4ATS should follow these principles:

1. **Research before production**
2. **Risk before execution**
3. **AI-assisted, policy-controlled automation**
4. **Reproducible quantitative experiments**
5. **Open-source interoperability**
6. **API-first integration**
7. **Observable systems**
8. **Secure financial credentials**
9. **Deterministic execution controls**
10. **Clear separation between reference technologies and actual dependencies**

---

# Conclusion

JFXAI4ATS provides a structured open-source foundation for exploring the convergence of **quantitative finance, artificial intelligence, algorithmic trading, financial messaging, market infrastructure, risk management and Model-Based Systems Engineering**.

Rather than representing a single monolithic trading application, the repository acts as an **architectural and software ecosystem for constructing automated trading platforms** from interchangeable open-source components.

The resulting architecture enables a progression from:

```text
Financial Data
      ↓
Quantitative Research
      ↓
AI / ML
      ↓
Trading Strategy
      ↓
Backtesting
      ↓
Risk Management
      ↓
Paper Trading
      ↓
Broker / Exchange Integration
      ↓
Controlled Production
      ↓
Business Intelligence
```

This approach provides a foundation for developing auditable, modular and extensible AI-powered trading systems while maintaining explicit separation between experimentation, simulation and real financial execution.
